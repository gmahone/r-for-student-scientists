# Introduction to R

## Downloading and Installing R

[Link for most systems](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/)

Ideally, in order to learn R you should use the newest available and stable release. The advantages are, for starting out, you won't need to manage dependencies and out of date libraries, etc. This is pretty useful if you are a non-advanced developer with no knowledge or things like conda, docker, etc.

## Starting with R - A Brief Tour

## Using an IDE for R

### RStudio

RStudio is a pretty popular choice in the R community. It is R-focused and therefore has limited functionality if you work in a multi-language context.

### VSCode

VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is a nice alternative for customization and ease of use, which is used by many in industry not only for R but for many other programming languages. It therefore has a lot of functionality in the form of customization through downloadable packages.

### Vim + Flavors

Only a few words to Vim, Emacs, etc. If you are using such an IDE you probably are familiar with docs and don't need to learn anything from this book.
