## Downloading and Installing R

## Starting with R - A Brief Tour

## Using an IDE for R

### RStudio

RStudio is a pretty popular choice in the R community. It is R-focused and therefore has limited functionality if you work in a multi-language context.

### VSCode

VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is a nice alternative for customization and ease of use, which is used by many in industry not only for R but for many other programming languages. It therefore has a lot of functionality in the form of customization through downloadable packages.

### Vim + Flavors

Only a few words to Vim, Emacs, etc. If you are using such an IDE you probably are familiar with docs and don't need to learn anything from this book.
